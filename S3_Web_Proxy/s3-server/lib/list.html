    This is an S3 Server. It proxies your requests to the {{s3Bucket}} S3 bucket.
    The current path you chose had a '/' at the end and I didn't find an index.html inside it,
    so here are all the subfolders I found instead:
    <ul>
      {{#prefixes}}
        <li><a href="/{{Prefix}}">{{Prefix}}</a></li>
      {{/prefixes}}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
