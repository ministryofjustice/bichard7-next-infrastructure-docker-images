# Vulnerability in Conductor for Spring Framework
# SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution. We recommend using SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content to restrict deserialization.
# Ignored as SnakeYaml is used by Spring Boot to parse trusted files in the project. Conductor also uses `*.properties` files instead of `*.yaml`.
